# Repository Automation

There are currently no automated bots or workflows running in this repository. All builds and deployments are performed manually by the maintainers.

## Adding or Updating Automation

If you introduce a GitHub Action, bot, or other automated process, document it here with:

- The name of the agent or workflow
- Its purpose and main tasks
- When it runs (e.g., on pull request, on push, scheduled)
- Instructions for updating or disabling it

Keeping this file up to date helps everyone understand how automation is used in NYC Feral Bee Survey.
